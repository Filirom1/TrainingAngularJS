	<h1>About providers</h1>

	<ul>

		<li>Services DI works as followed:</li>

		<ol>
			<li>A controller/directive/service/etc. need a service named <i>UserService</i>...</li>
			<li>Angular will search for the provider called <i>UserServiceProvider</i> in the provider cache...</li>
			<li>It calls its method <i>$get</i> to create <i>UserService</i> instance...</li>
			<li>And stores it in the services cache, for further use (services are singletons).</li>
		</ol>

		<li>
			There are several types of services, and most of time, you will not have to define a 
			<em>provider</em> for your service. In such a case, it will be created under the hood by Angular.
		</li>
		<li>
			Providers have the same name than the services prefixed by <em>Provider</em>, 
			and are usefull when you need to configure your service...
		</li>
