			<em>AngularJs</em> is designed for SPA, so it is not really 
			compliant with Portlet based architecture (even if it is not 
			impossible, it is not recommended)
		</li>
		<li>
			To make an AngularJs application, be sure that a good 
			javascript knowledge is mandatory
		</li>
		<li>
			AngularJS 1.3 is dropping support for IE8.
			Be sure that your client is aware of this situation
			which can have impacts in terms of accessibility
			(IE8 still generates 25% of the whole traffic...).
			And be sure to define the list of supported browsers for your
			applcation.
		</li>
		<li>
			According to the Google Team, the next version (2.0) 
			of AngularJS will introduce many breaking changes. 
			So any new project which will start with the current 
			release (1.3),  may have to be completely rewrote in 
			about 6 Months
		</li>
		<li>
			Keep in mind that best practices about topics like 
			Authentication ,  XSS &amp; CRSF must be defined at 
			the beginning of your project if you want to be 
			consistent with OWASP and PCI
