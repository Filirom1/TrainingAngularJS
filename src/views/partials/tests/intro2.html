	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>AngularJS</strong> is a great framework for testing all the functionalities of 
			your application.</li>
		<li>
			It provides <strong>Unit testing</strong> and <strong>End-to-End (E2E) 
			testing</strong>. Both have different purposes:
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Unit testing</strong>: Isolates and tests small "units" of code, without 
				taking context into consideration.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>E2E testing</strong>: Runs and tests full areas of an application, from the beginning to
				the end. Generally, they reproduce typical user operations.
			</li>
		</ul>
